		<h2>60 Second Dance Film Opportunity</h2>
		<h3>Opportunity for Emerging Artists aged 18-24 for two day project at mac in October 2015.</h3>
		<p>This is an exciting opportunity for BME emerging artists to take part in the creation of a new, site- specific 60-second screen dance film.</p>

		<p>Working in collaboration with screen director Sima Gonsai, Bharatanatyam classical dance choreographer Chitraleka Bolar and production company Rebel Uncut, artists will gain hands on experience working with professional film, dance and production crew to create a 60 second prelude to “The Offering” short film. </p>

		<p>“The Offering” is a short drama film that follows the journey of an aspiring young dancer who uses dance to cope with the recent loss of her mother. Funded by Arts Council, BFI NET.WORK and Creative England, the film combines dance, music and drama to create a semi autobiographical story depicting the loving relationship between a mother and daughter.</p>

		<p>The 60 second short will be a pure dance film that will explore elements of ‘The Offering” and will be rehearsed and filmed at Cannon Hill Park in September. The film will then be screened at mac in late October and submitted to the 60-second dance film touring film festival.</p>

		<p>We are looking for 4 emerging artists: an Indian Classical singer, percussion musician, dance choreographer and filmmaker. Artists must be aged between 18 – 24.</p>

		<p>This opportunity will run over two days at mac rehearsal studios and will include;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Shadow and participate in the process of creating a new screen dance piece.</li>
			<li>Gain an understanding of “screen dance” including viewing work from the current 60 second dance festival.</li>
			<li>Collaborate with dancers from Chitraleka Dance Company and associated artists.</li>
			<li>A 2-day rehearsal period and 1 day filming.</li>
			<li>Opportunity to screen the film at mac cinema and share the process as part of an artist talk.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Rehearsals aim to take place week beginning 5th October and filming week beginning 12th Oct.</p>

		<p>This is part of the Next Generation programme providing opportunities for emerging artists. Please send a short expression of interest by email to Sima Gonsai at <a href="mailto"sima@tequestamedia.co.uk>sima@tequestamedia.co.uk</a>.

		<p>Deadline for applications is 05 October.</p>
